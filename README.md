# VIVA: Bus Ticket Reservation System

<!-- This is a project work that I'm working on throughout the semester. This is to demonstrate practically how to apply server-side scripting language (PHP)
and MYSQL to build the backend of the application.

The name VIVA was coined to be the name of this transport service provider. 

### This system is to be implemented using PHP and MYSQL technologies. The specific objectives of this Online Bus Ticket Reservation System are as follows:

1. Provide a web-based bus ticket reservation function where a customer can buy bus ticket through the online system without a need to queue up at the counter to purchase a ticket.

2. Enabling customers to check the availability and types of buses online. Customers can check the departure time for every bus through the system.

3. Easing bus ticket payment by incorporating electronic payment options

4. The ability of customers to cancel their reservation.

5. Admin user privileges in updating and canceling payment, route and vehicle records.
